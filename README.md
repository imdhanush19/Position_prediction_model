ABOUT PROJECT:
This project explores the predictive capabilities of various machine learning algorithms for forecasting football players' best positions, overall ratings, and potential based on their statistical attributes. Leveraging linear regression, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes, and decision trees, we examine the effectiveness of each algorithm in accurately estimating these critical player metrics. Through comprehensive analysis and experimentation, our project aims to provide insights into the most suitable algorithmic approaches for predicting player positions, overall ratings, and potential, thus offering valuable guidance for talent scouting, team composition, and strategic decision-making in the realm of football analytics.
ABOUT DATASET:
Our dataset provides a comprehensive profile of each football player, including both their physical attributes and their skills on the field. Over 16,000 unique players are included in the dataset, providing a comprehensive view of the FIFA football community. With more than 60 columns, the dataset encompasses a wide range of general information and key performance indicators (KPIs), offering rich insights into player behaviour and performance. The dataset includes general player information as well as detailed metrics on various aspects of performance on the field. An external scraping software was used to obtain the dataset from the game. The game developers have a large network of real-life scouts who attend games and watch game tapes to determine the performance scores assigned to each player in the game.
